A simple statistic program that simulates a game of dice and display the statisistical results of the game.

This was requested by my Math Professor.

About the Program:
Simulate rolling a set of (n) fair, six-sided dice (m) times. 
Each time you roll a six, you score +4; each time you roll a five, you score +2; each time you roll a four, your score is unchanged; each time you roll a one, two, or three, you score -1 i.e. your score gets lowered by one.
Log each set of accumilated points then turn it into a frequency table.
The table will display all the output, the frequency of those outputs, and the probability.
Furthermore, it also calulates and display the mean, median and standard deviation of the results.
